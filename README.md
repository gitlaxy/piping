# piping
Pipework exercise
This python code attempts to replicate part (b) of the book exercise (Example: Taking a Shower and Flushing a Toilet (from Cengel and cimbala)) shown here:

fsolve, from scipy, is used to solve the system of equations (12 eqs and 12 unknowns).

The python code's volumetric solution is:

  **v1_dot** = 0.001260, **v2_dot** = 0.000629, **v3_dot** = 0.000631.

HOWEVER, the solution reported in the above link is:

  **v1_dot** = 0.0009, **v1_dot** = 0.00042, **v1_dot** = 0.00048.

Something might be wrong with my code!
